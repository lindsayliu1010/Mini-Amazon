# TEAM DATA DAWGS - Bark Boutique

Our group has opted to complete the Standard Mini-Amazon Project.
We have also decided to get graded as a group.

### The Pack

##### Divya Nataraj, Gargi Mahadeshwar, Lindsay Liu, Soumya Bodavula, Pradnesh Kolluru

## Running Website

1. run `./install.sh`. This will install a bunch of things, set
   up an important file called `.flashenv`, and creates a simple
   PostgreSQL database named `amazon`.
2. Issue the following Commands

```
poetry shell
flask run
```

3. If you use containers on your own laptop, point your browser to
   http://localhost:8080/
4. To stop your app, type <kbd>CTRL</kbd>-<kbd>C</kbd> in the container
   shell; that will take you back to the command-line prompt, still
   inside the `poetry` environment. If you are all done with this app for
   now, you can type `exit` to get out of the `poetry` environment and
   get back to the normal container shell

### Project Overview

I learned a lot about the positioning such as relative, fixed, absolute, and sticky. In the future, I want to add persistance with my product filter buttons. Code used for products were copy and pasted into multiple html files. I tried to figrue out a way so that I could turn the product card into a component and then pass product information into the component and then add it to multiple HTML files, so my code would be less redundant, but I could not figure it out. I wonder if there is a way to do that, and if so, that would be my first goal in the next stretch.
